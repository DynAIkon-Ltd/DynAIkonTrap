This module provides a generic interface to an animal detector. The system is fairly agnostic of the specific animal detection mechanism beings used, as the input to the `AnimalFilter` is a JPEG image and the output a confidence in the image containing an animal.

A WCS-trained Tiny YOLOv4 model is used in this implementation, but any other architecture could be substituted in its place easily. Such a substitution would not require any changes to the module interface.
