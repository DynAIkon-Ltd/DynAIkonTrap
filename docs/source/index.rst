Welcome to DynAIkonTrap!
========================

*An AI-enabled camera trap design targeted at the* **Raspberry Pi platform**.

DynAIkonTrap makes use of a continuous stream from a camera attached to the
Raspberry Pi, analysing only the stream to detect animals. Animal detections can
be used to save or send individual frames from the video, or even whole video
segments. The beauty of this is that the system does not rely on any secondary
sensors like PIR sensors and acts on exactly what the camera sees.
