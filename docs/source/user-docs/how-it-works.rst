How it Works
============

DynAIkonTrap has two main modes (pipelines) of operation. One pipeline is suited to low-powered Raspberry Pi devices. The other has been designed in an earlier iteration of the software for operation on RPi 4B. We refer to these as “Legacy” and “Low-powered” pipelines.

Closing Remarks

These pages give brief insight into the architecture design, but you may have more questions. If that is the case please do get in touch and we'd love to discuss and explain things further.
